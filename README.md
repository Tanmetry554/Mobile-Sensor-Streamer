# Mobile-Sensor-Streamer
This project turns your Android phone into a real-time wireless sensor hub, streaming data like motion, orientation, GPS, and battery info to a Python dashboard. The PC app visualizes orientation in 3D, tracks location on a live map, and displays all sensor readings instantly â€” ideal for robotics, motion analysis, and IoT experiments.
